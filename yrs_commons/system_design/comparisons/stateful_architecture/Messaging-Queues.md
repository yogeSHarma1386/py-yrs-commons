|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kafka**    | Self-managed infra, or Confluent Cloud (expensive for high-throughput workloads) | Message logs stored on disk; consumers can replay from offsets; **retention configurable** by time or size |
| **RabbitMQ** | Open-source; self-hosted; plugins may add overhead                               | Messages kept until **acknowledged**, optionally persisted to disk; TTL + DLQ supported                    |
| **ActiveMQ** | Open-source; may require tuning/monitoring                                       | Messages stored persistently (file/db); supports redelivery policies                                       |
| **SQS**      | **Pay-per-request** + storage fees ($0.40/million requests + $0.09/GB-month)     | Messages retained up to **14 days**; FIFO and delay queues supported                                       |
| **Kinesis**  | **$0.015/shard-hour** + **$0.014/million PUT payload units**                     | Data retained 24 hours (default) up to **365 days** (extended retention); charges apply for extended       |
| **Pulsar**   | Self-hosted or managed; tiered storage reduces costs                             | **Tiered storage**: hot data in memory/SSD, cold data in object storage (S3/GCS/Azure)                     |

## 📝 Detailed Description

### **1. Apache Kafka**

* **Core Concept**: Distributed log-based pub/sub system designed for high throughput and fault tolerance.
* **Key Strengths**: Efficient at handling huge volumes of real-time data. Ideal for **data pipelines**, **stream processing**, and **event sourcing**.
* **Storage**: Messages are persisted in logs, and consumers can rewind/read from any point.
* **Scalability**: Partitioning across brokers allows for horizontal scalability.
* **Limitations**: 
  - Default 1MB message size (can cause issues with large payloads)
  - Partition rebalancing can cause temporary unavailability
  - ZooKeeper dependency (being phased out with KRaft)
* **Drawbacks**: Requires more setup and tuning. Does not have built-in message routing logic (like topics/queues in RabbitMQ).

### **2. RabbitMQ**

* **Core Concept**: Traditional message broker implementing the **AMQP** protocol.
* **Use Case**: Excellent for **job queues**, **RPC**, **task offloading**, and scenarios needing complex **routing patterns** (via exchanges).
* **Features**: Built-in support for **dead letter queues**, **retry**, **acknowledgments**, and **multiple protocols**.
* **Management**: Comes with an excellent management UI and plugins.
* **Limitations**:
  - Performance degrades with large queue depths
  - Clustering can be complex and has split-brain risks
  - Memory usage can spike with unacknowledged messages
* **Drawbacks**: Limited throughput compared to Kafka. Performance decreases with larger queues.

### **3. ActiveMQ**

* **Core Concept**: Mature message broker from Apache, often used with **JMS (Java Message Service)**.
* **Strengths**: Enterprise-ready, supports multiple wire protocols (OpenWire, MQTT, AMQP).
* **Flexibility**: Supports both queues and topics, transactions, and various delivery modes.
* **Use Case**: Often used in **legacy enterprise apps** or **Java EE ecosystems**.
* **Limitations**:
  - Lower performance compared to modern alternatives
  - Complex configuration for high availability
  - Limited horizontal scalability
* **Drawbacks**: Aging architecture compared to Kafka. Performance is lower and not ideal for massive data streams.

### **4. Amazon SQS**

* **Core Concept**: Fully managed, highly available, and scalable queueing service from AWS.
* **Strengths**: Zero operational overhead. Built-in support for **dead-letter queues**, **delay queues**, and **message timers**.
* **Types**: Offers **Standard queues** (at-least-once, best-effort order) and **FIFO queues** (guaranteed order, exactly-once).
* **Use Case**: Great for **microservices**, **serverless**, **autoscaling systems**.
* **Limitations**:
  - 256KB message size limit (requires S3 for larger messages)
  - FIFO queues limited to 300 TPS (3000 with batching)
  - 14-day maximum retention
  - No message replay capability
* **Drawbacks**: Higher latency. Vendor lock-in. FIFO queues have limited throughput.

### **5. Amazon Kinesis**

* **Core Concept**: Fully managed streaming data service for real-time data ingestion and processing.
* **Architecture**: Stream-based with shards, each shard handles ordered records with sequence numbers.
* **Key Strengths**: 
  - Seamless integration with AWS ecosystem (Lambda, Analytics, Firehose)
  - Auto-scaling (with Kinesis Scaling Utility or Application Auto Scaling)
  - Multiple consumers can read same data stream independently
* **Features**:
  - **Kinesis Data Streams**: Real-time data streaming
  - **Kinesis Data Firehose**: Load streaming data into data stores
  - **Kinesis Data Analytics**: SQL queries on streaming data
* **Use Cases**: 
  - Real-time analytics and dashboards
  - Log and event data collection
  - IoT device data ingestion
  - Clickstream analytics
* **Limitations**:
  - 1MB per record size limit
  - 1MB/sec or 1000 records/sec per shard ingestion limit
  - Resharding is a manual process (though improving)
  - More expensive than SQS for simple queuing
* **Drawbacks**: 
  - Shard management complexity
  - No built-in DLQ (must implement manually)
  - Limited to 5 consumers per shard
  - AWS vendor lock-in

### **6. Apache Pulsar**

* **Core Concept**: Cloud-native, distributed messaging and streaming platform designed from ground up for modern workloads.
* **Architecture**: 
  - **Layered architecture**: Separates compute (brokers) from storage (BookKeeper)
  - **Segment-centric**: Instead of partition-centric like Kafka
  - **Multi-tenancy**: Built-in tenant and namespace isolation
* **Key Strengths**:
  - **Unified messaging model**: Queuing and streaming in one system
  - **Geo-replication**: Native support for multi-datacenter replication
  - **Multi-tenancy**: True isolation between tenants
  - **Tiered storage**: Automatic offloading to cloud storage
  - **Better performance**: Lower latency than Kafka, especially for long tail percentiles
* **Features**:
  - **Functions**: Lightweight compute framework (like Kafka Streams)
  - **Schema registry**: Built-in schema management
  - **Transactions**: Native support for transactions
  - **SQL**: Pulsar SQL for querying with Presto
* **Subscription Types**:
  - **Exclusive**: Only one consumer
  - **Shared**: Multiple consumers, round-robin delivery
  - **Failover**: Active-standby consumers
  - **Key_Shared**: Key-based distribution to consumers
* **Use Cases**:
  - Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
  - Unified streaming and queuing workloads
  - Geo-distributed applications
  - Mission-critical messaging with low latency requirements
* **Limitations**:
  - Newer ecosystem (less tooling/integration than Kafka)
  - More complex architecture (BookKeeper + Brokers)
  - Requires ZooKeeper (for metadata)
  - Learning curve for operations team
* **Advantages over Kafka**:
  - No partition rebalancing (segment-based storage)
  - True streaming and queuing in one system
  - Better multi-tenancy
  - Native geo-replication
  - Tiered storage built-in
