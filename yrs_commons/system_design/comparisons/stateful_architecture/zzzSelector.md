## Selection Factors to Consider

1. **Data model complexity**: Structured vs. unstructured data
2. **Scale requirements**: Vertical vs. horizontal scaling needs
3. **Query patterns**: Simple lookups vs. complex analytics
4. **Consistency needs**: Strong consistency vs. eventual consistency
5. **Write vs. read ratio**: High-write vs. high-read workloads
6. **Development velocity**: Schema flexibility vs. strict enforcement
7. **Operational experience**: Team familiarity with the technology

Most modern applications use multiple database types together in a polyglot persistence architecture to leverage the strengths of each for different aspects of the application.

# Real-World Use Cases for CAP Theorem Choices

## CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
*Prioritize correct data over availability*

| Use Case                             | Description                                 | Why CP                                                                  | Example                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Banking & Financial Transactions** | Interbank transfers and payment processing  | Must prevent double-spending and ensure accurate balances               | Banking cores using distributed transactions, MongoDB in strong consistency mode |
| **Airline Ticket Reservation**       | Ensuring each seat is sold only once        | Cannot overbook specific seats; consistency trumps availability         | Distributed reservation systems using consensus protocols                        |
| **Distributed Leader Election**      | Kubernetes master node selection            | Only one leader must be elected; split-brain scenarios are unacceptable | ZooKeeper, etcd coordinating containerized applications                          |
| **Inventory Management**             | E-commerce stock tracking for limited items | Cannot sell more items than in stock for limited inventory              | HBase-backed inventory systems                                                   |

## AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
*Prioritize uptime over perfect data*

| Use Case                      | Description                                | Why AP                                                                  | Example                                                     |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Social Media Feeds**        | Facebook/Twitter timeline delivery         | Users prefer seeing slightly outdated content over no content           | Cassandra clusters storing user activity                    |
| **Content Delivery Networks** | Netflix streaming, static content delivery | Temporary inconsistency (stale content) is preferable to service outage | DynamoDB with eventual consistency for metadata             |
| **Real-time Analytics**       | E-commerce product recommendations         | Approximate, eventually consistent results are acceptable               | Cassandra storing user browsing history for recommendations |
| **Collaborative Editing**     | Google Docs simultaneous editing           | Local changes appear immediately; conflicts resolved later              | CouchDB with conflict resolution for document collaboration |

## CA Systems (Consistency + Availability)
*Single-node or synchronized systems without true partition tolerance*

| Use Case                           | Description                                   | Why CA                                                                            | Example                                                        |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Banking Core**       | Account management within a single datacenter | High consistency and availability within controlled network                       | Oracle RAC with synchronous replication in a single datacenter |
| **Single-Region Web Applications** | Monolithic CRUD applications                  | Simplified development for applications without geographic distribution           | PostgreSQL with read replicas in same zone                     |
| **Legacy Enterprise Systems**      | Traditional ERP systems                       | Built before distributed architectures became common                              | Single-instance SQL Server deployments                         |
| **In-Memory Data Grids**           | Session caching in a single datacenter        | Fast, consistent reads and writes with high availability when network is reliable | Redis clusters in non-partitioned environments                 |

**Note:** True CA systems are theoretical in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. They're typically single-node systems or tightly coupled clusters in controlled environments.

## Protocol Selection by Technical Requirements

| Requirement          | Protocol Options              | Data Format Options               | Considerations                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Low Bandwidth        | gRPC, MQTT, CoAP              | Protobuf, MessagePack, CBOR       | Binary formats significantly reduce payload size       |
| Low Latency          | WebSockets, gRPC, MQTT        | Binary formats                    | Persistent connections avoid handshake overhead        |
| Strong Typing        | gRPC, SOAP, tRPC              | Protobuf, Thrift, XML Schema      | Schema-defined messages enforce data contracts         |
| Broad Compatibility  | REST, SOAP                    | JSON, XML                         | Widely supported across platforms and languages        |
| Self-documenting     | GraphQL, OData, HATEOAS       | JSON Schema, OpenAPI              | Introspection capabilities help discovery              |
| Offline Operation    | Any + sync protocol           | Any + conflict resolution         | Local storage and eventual consistency                 |
| Binary Data Transfer | gRPC, WebSockets              | Protobuf, MessagePack, raw binary | Efficient binary handling without encoding overhead    |
| Streaming Data       | WebSockets, SSE, gRPC         | Any (chunked)                     | Server push capabilities for real-time updates         |
| Partial Updates      | GraphQL, PATCH                | JSON Patch, JSON Merge Patch      | Selective field updating to minimize transfer          |
| Complex Transactions | SOAP, REST (with conventions) | XML, JSON                         | Transaction support often requires additional patterns |
