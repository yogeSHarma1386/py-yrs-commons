## 1. Prefix Sum

Prefix Sum involves preprocessing an array to create a new array where each element at index i represents the sum of the array from the start up to i. This allows for efficient sum queries on subarrays.

Use this pattern when you need to perform multiple sum queries on a subarray or need to calculate cumulative sums.

### Sample Problem:
Given an array nums, answer multiple queries about the sum of elements within a specific range [i, j].

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `i = 1`, `j = 3`
- Output: `9`

**Explanation:**
Preprocess the array A to create a prefix sum array: `P = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]`.
To find the sum between indices i and j, use the formula: `P[j] - P[i-1]`.

## 2. Two Pointers

The Two Pointers pattern involves using two pointers to iterate through an array or list, often used to find pairs or elements that meet specific criteria.

Use this pattern when dealing with sorted arrays or lists where you need to find pairs that satisfy a specific condition.

### Sample Problem:
Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target value.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, `target = 6`
- Output: `[1, 3]`

**Explanation:**
Initialize two pointers, one at the start (left) and one at the end (right) of the array. Check the sum of the elements at the two pointers. If the sum equals the target, return the indices. If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left.

## 3. Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.

Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

### Sample Problem:
Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`, `k = 3`
- Output: `9`

**Explanation:**
Start with the sum of the first k elements. Slide the window one element at a time, subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the new element. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

## 4. Fast & Slow Pointers

The Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare) pattern is used to detect cycles in linked lists and other similar structures.

### Sample Problem:
Detect if a linked list has a cycle.

**Explanation:**
Initialize two pointers, one moving one step at a time (slow) and the other moving two steps at a time (fast). If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, there is no cycle.

## 5. LinkedList In-place Reversal

The In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern reverses parts of a linked list without using extra space.

Use this pattern when you need to reverse sections of a linked list.

### Sample Problem:
Reverse a sublist of a linked list from position m to n.

**Example:**
- Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `m = 2`, `n = 4`
- Output: `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`

**Explanation:**
Identify the start and end of the sublist. Reverse the nodes in place by adjusting the pointers.

## 6. Monotonic Stack

The Monotonic Stack pattern uses a stack to maintain a sequence of elements in a specific order (increasing or decreasing).

Use this pattern for problems that require finding the next greater or smaller element.

### Sample Problem:
Find the next greater element for each element in an array. Output -1 if the greater element doesn't exist.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [2, 1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Output: `[4, 2, 4, -1, -1]`

**Explanation:**
Use a stack to keep track of elements for which we haven't found the next greater element yet. Iterate through the array, and for each element, pop elements from the stack until you find a greater element. If the stack is not empty, set the result for index at the top of the stack to current element. Push the current element onto the stack.

## 7. Top 'K' Elements

The Top 'K' Elements pattern finds the top k largest or smallest elements in an array or stream of data using heaps or sorting.

### Sample Problem:
Find the k-th largest element in an unsorted array.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `5`

**Explanation:**
Use a min-heap of size k to keep track of the k largest elements. Iterate through the array, adding elements to the heap. If the heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest element from the heap. The root of the heap will be the k-th largest element.

## 8. Overlapping Intervals

The Overlapping Intervals pattern is used to merge or handle overlapping intervals in an array.

In an interval array sorted by start time, two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] overlap if b >= c (i.e., the end time of the first interval is greater than or equal to the start time of the second interval).

### Sample Problem:
Merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example:**
- Input: `intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`
- Output: `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`

**Explanation:**
Sort the intervals by their start time. Create an empty list called merged to store the merged intervals. Iterate through the intervals and check if it overlaps with the last interval in the merged list. If it overlaps, merge the intervals by updating the end time of the last interval in merged. If it does not overlap, simply add the current interval to the merged list.

## 9. Modified Binary Search

The Modified Binary Search pattern adapts binary search to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding elements in rotated sorted arrays.

Use this pattern for problems involving sorted or rotated arrays where you need to find a specific element.

### Sample Problem:
Find an element in a rotated sorted array.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 0`
- Output: `4`

**Explanation:**
Perform binary search with an additional check to determine which half of the array is sorted. We then check if the target is within the range of the sorted half. If it is, we search that half; otherwise, we search the other half.

## 10. Binary Tree Traversal

Binary Tree Traversal involves visiting all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order.

- **PreOrder**: root â†’ left â†’ right
- **InOrder**: left â†’ root â†’ right
- **PostOrder**: left â†’ right â†’ root

### Sample Problem:
Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree.

**Example:**
- Input: `root = [1, null, 2, 3]`
- Output: `[1, 3, 2]`

**Explanation:**
Inorder traversal visits nodes in the order: left, root, right. Use recursion or a stack to traverse the tree in this order.

## 11. Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal technique that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

Use this pattern for exploring all paths or branches in graphs or trees.

### Sample Problem:
Find all paths from the root to leaves in a binary tree.

**Example:**
- Input: `root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5]`
- Output: `["1->2->5", "1->3"]`

**Explanation:**
Use recursion or a stack to traverse each path from the root to the leaves. Record each path as you traverse.

## 12. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal technique that explores nodes level by level in a tree or graph.

Use this pattern for finding the shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order traversal in trees.

### Sample Problem:
Perform level-order traversal of a binary tree.

**Example:**
- Input: `root = [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]`
- Output: `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

**Explanation:**
Use a queue to keep track of nodes at each level. Traverse each level and add the children of the current nodes to the queue.

## 13. Matrix Traversal

Matrix Traversal involves traversing elements in a matrix using different techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.).

Use this pattern for problems involving traversing 2D grids or matrices horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

### Sample Problem:
Perform flood fill on a 2D grid. Change all the cells connected to the starting cell to new color.

**Example:**
- Input: `image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]`, `sr = 1`, `sc = 1`, `newColor = 2`
- Output: `[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]`

**Explanation:**
Use DFS or BFS to traverse the matrix starting from the given cell. Change the color of the connected cells to the new color.

## 14. Backtracking

Backtracking explores all possible solutions and backtracks when a solution path fails.

Use this pattern when you need to find all (or some) solutions to a problem that satisfies given constraints. For example: combinatorial problems, such as generating permutations, combinations, or subsets.

### Sample Problem:
Generate all permutations of a given list of numbers.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- Output: `[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]`

**Explanation:**
Use recursion to generate permutations. For each element, include it in the current permutation and recursively generate the remaining permutations. Backtrack when all permutations for a given path are generated.

## 15. Dynamic Programming Patterns

Dynamic Programming (DP) involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and solving them using a bottom-up or top-down approach.

Use this pattern for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

DP itself has multiple sub-patterns. Some of the most important ones are:
- Fibonacci Numbers
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Subset Sum
- Matrix Chain Multiplication

### Sample Problem:
Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

**Example:**
- Input: `n = 5`
- Output: `5` (The first five Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)

**Explanation:**
Use a bottom-up approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. Start with the first two numbers (0 and 1) and iterate to calculate the next numbers like `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]`.

## 1. Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence pattern is useful when the solution to a problem depends on the solutions of smaller instances of the same problem. There is a clear recursive relationship, often resembling the classic Fibonacci sequence F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

## 2. Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is primarily used for solving the Maximum Subarray Problem and its variations where the problem asks to optimize a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array.

## 3. 0/1 Knapsack

The 0/1 Knapsack pattern is useful when:
- You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value
- You need to select a subset of these items
- There's a constraint on the total weight (or some other resource) you can use
- You want to maximize (or minimize) the total value of the selected items
- Each item can be chosen only once (hence the "0/1" - you either take it or you don't)

## 4. Unbounded Knapsack

The Unbounded Knapsack pattern is useful when:
- You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value
- You need to select items to maximize total value
- There's a constraint on the total weight (or some other resource) you can use
- You can select each item multiple times (unlike 0/1 Knapsack where each item can be chosen only once)
- The supply of each item is considered infinite

## 5. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

The Longest Common Subsequence pattern is useful when you are given two sequences and need to find a subsequence that appears in the same order in both the given sequences.

## 6. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

The Longest Increasing Subsequence pattern is used to solve problems that involve finding the longest subsequence of elements in a sequence where the elements are in increasing order.

## 7. Palindromic Subsequence

The Palindromic Subsequence pattern is used when solving problems that involve finding a subsequence within a sequence (usually a string) that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## 8. Edit Distance

The Edit Distance pattern is used to solve problems that involve transforming one sequence (usually a string) into another sequence using a minimum number of operations. The allowed operations typically include insertion, deletion, and substitution.

## 9. Subset Sum

The Subset Sum pattern is used to solve problems where you need to determine whether a subset of elements from a given set can sum up to a specific target value.

## 10. String Partition

The String Partition pattern is used to solve problems that involve partitioning a string into smaller substrings that satisfy certain conditions.

It's useful when:
- You're working with problems involving strings or sequences
- The problem requires splitting the string into substrings or subsequences
- You need to optimize some property over these partitions (e.g., minimize cost, maximize value)
- The solution to the overall problem can be built from solutions to subproblems on smaller substrings
- There's a need to consider different ways of partitioning the string

## 11. Catalan Numbers

The Catalan Number pattern is used to solve combinatorial problems that can be decomposed into smaller, similar subproblems.

Some of the use-cases of this pattern include:
- Counting the number of valid parentheses expressions of a given length
- Counting the number of distinct binary search trees that can be formed with n nodes
- Counting the number of ways to triangulate a polygon with n+2 sides

## 12. Matrix Chain Multiplication

This pattern is used to solve problems that involve determining the optimal order of operations to minimize the cost of performing a series of operations. It is based on the popular optimization problem: Matrix Chain Multiplication.

It's useful when:
- You're dealing with a sequence of elements that can be combined pairwise
- The cost of combining elements depends on the order of combination
- You need to find the optimal way to combine the elements
- The problem involves minimizing (or maximizing) the cost of operations of combining the elements

## 13. Count Distinct Ways

This pattern is useful when:
- You need to count the number of different ways to achieve a certain goal or reach a particular state
- The problem involves making a series of choices or steps to reach a target
- There are multiple valid paths or combinations to reach the solution
- The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems with overlapping solutions
- You're dealing with combinatorial problems that ask "in how many ways" can something be done

## 14. DP on Grids

The DP on Grids pattern is used to solve problems that involve navigating or optimizing paths within a grid (2D array). For these problems, you need to consider multiple directions of movement (e.g., right, down, diagonal) and solution at each cell depends on the solutions of neighboring cells.

## 15. DP on Trees

The DP on Trees pattern is useful when:
- You're working with tree-structured data represented by nodes and edges
- The problem can be broken down into solutions of subproblems that are themselves tree problems
- The problem requires making decisions at each node that affect its children or parent
- You need to compute values for nodes based on their children or ancestors

## 16. DP on Graphs

The DP on Graphs pattern is useful when:
- You're dealing with problems involving graph structures
- The problem requires finding optimal paths, longest paths, cycles, or other optimized properties on graphs
- You need to compute values for nodes or edges based on their neighbors or connected components
- The problem involves traversing a graph while maintaining some state

## 17. Digit DP

The Digit DP Pattern is useful when:
- You're dealing with problems involving counting or summing over a range of numbers
- The problem requires considering the digits of numbers individually
- You need to find patterns or properties related to the digits of numbers within a range
- The range of numbers is large (often up to 10^18 or more), making brute force approaches infeasible
- The problem involves constraints on the digits

## 18. Bitmasking DP

The Bitmasking DP pattern is used to solve problems that involve a large number of states or combinations, where each state can be efficiently represented using bits in an integer.

It's particularly useful when:
- You're dealing with problems involving subsets or combinations of elements
- The total number of elements is relatively small (typically <= 20-30)
- You need to efficiently represent and manipulate sets of elements
- The problem involves making decisions for each element (include/exclude) or tracking visited/unvisited states
- You want to optimize space usage in DP solutions

## 19. Probability DP

This pattern is useful when:
- You're dealing with problems involving probability calculations
- The probability of a state depends on the probabilities of previous states
- You need to calculate the expected value of an outcome
- The problem involves random processes or games of chance

## 20. State Machine DP

The State Machine DP Pattern is useful when:
- The problem can be modeled as a series of states and transitions between these states
- There are clear rules for moving from one state to another
- The optimal solution depends on making the best sequence of state transitions
- The problem involves making decisions that affect future states
- There's a finite number of possible states, and each state can be clearly defined
